The height of the water level in Lake Huron fluctuates over time. Here I 'analyze' the variation using R. I show a histogram of the lake levels for the period 1875 to 1972.
```{r LakeHuron}
hist(LakeHuron)
```
```{r 2}
lowHi <- c(which.min(LakeHuron), which.max(LakeHuron)) 
yearExtrema <- attributes(LakeHuron)$tsp[1]-1 + lowHi
```
